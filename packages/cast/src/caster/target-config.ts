 * What a `_target.yml` declares.

 * Deliberately no `name`. A target is addressed by the directory holding this file — that is
 * what `--target=` names and what the site discovers — so a `name:` inside it could only be a
 * second answer to a question the directory already settled.
 *
 * Deliberately no `provenance_schema_version`. The record's shape is the CASTER's, not the
 * target's, so the version travels with the code that emits it — `PROVENANCE_SCHEMA_VERSION`
 * in @galaxy-foundry/cast. A target that declared its own could name a shape the caster does
 * not write, and the JSON Schema at scripts/lib/schemas/cast-provenance.schema.json stays the
 * contract of record: `make check-verify` validates every committed record against it, so the
 * two are cross-checked rather than merely restated.
