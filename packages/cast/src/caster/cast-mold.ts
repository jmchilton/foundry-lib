// The cast itself: everything between a loaded Mold and a published bundle.
//
// This function reads nothing it was not handed. Where a Foundry keeps its Molds, its targets
// and its reference contract are facts about that Foundry's tree, so the caller finds them and
// passes what it found; what happens to a resolved ref afterwards is the same everywhere.
//
// It also prints nothing. Errors and drift come back as VALUES, because a cast that found four
// unresolved refs has produced a result rather than suffered a failure, and how a caller wants
// to render that — a CLI's stderr lines, a test's assertion, a future editor's squiggles — is
// not casting's business. The one thing it does decide is whether to publish, since that is a
// question about the staged bundle rather than about presentation.
