// Where instance knowledge attaches to a generic caster.
//
// Casting itself is domain-free: resolve each ref to a file, place its bytes, hash both ends,
// report drift, write the provenance record. Everything a Foundry adds on top of that is its own
// knowledge — Galaxy's artifact contracts, CLI tooling and planemo command shape here, something
// else entirely in the next instance — and it reaches the caster through this interface alone.
//
// The rest of this directory is that caster, which is why each point below is a value handed in
// rather than a branch taken inside. The test of a point being in the right place is that this
// instance supplies it and a second instance supplies nothing: a Foundry whose corpus is
// research notes has no artifacts, no tools, and no commands, and should still cast.
//
// The provenance `artifacts` block is not among them, and does not need to be. Casting reserves
// one slot in the record for whatever an instance records beyond the refs, so the block is
// supplied at the call rather than declared as a point here — see lib/artifact-contract.ts for
// the vocabulary and @galaxy-foundry/cast's `provenanceRecord` for where it lands.
